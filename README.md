# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of solved exercises in the C programming language, organized by key programming topics. These exercises were developed during the first semester of the Software Engineering program at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), as part of the course *Fundamentos da Programação* (Programming Fundamentals – FUNP), class of 2025.1.

## Project Structure

- **index/** – Index manipulation and data structure positioning.
- **matrix/** – Operations with two-dimensional arrays.
- **output/** – Exercises focused on data output and formatting.
